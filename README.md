# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Sentiment140 dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This project leverages machine learning to classify tweets as positive or negative. By analyzing the sentiments of tweets, we can gain insights into public opinion on various topics.

## Dataset

The Sentiment140 dataset is used in this project. It contains 1.6 million tweets, each labeled with a sentiment score:
- 0: Negative
- 2: Neutral
- 4: Positive

The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Sentiment140 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
